#  Week 1: September 1st - September 7th

## Largest Time for Given Digits (September 1st)

Given an array of 4 digits, return the largest 24 hour time that can be made.

The smallest 24 hour time is 00:00, and the largest is 23:59.  Starting from 00:00, a time is larger if more time has elapsed since midnight.

Return the answer as a string of length 5.  If no valid time can be made, return an empty string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4]
Output: "23:41"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [5,5,5,5]
Output: ""
```

**Note:**

1. `A.length == 4`
2. `0 <= A[i] <= 9`

## Contains Duplicate III (September 2nd)

Given an array of integers, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that the **absolute** difference between **nums[i]** and **nums[j]** is at most t and the **absolute** difference between i and j is at most k.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3, t = 0
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1, t = 2
Output: true
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,5,9,1,5,9], k = 2, t = 3
Output: false
```

**Hint #1:**

```
Time complexity O(n logk) - This will give an indication that sorting is involved for k elements.
```

**Hint #2:**

```
Use already existing state to evaluate next state - Like, a set of k sorted numbers are only needed to be tracked. When we are processing the next number in array, then we can utilize the existing sorted state and it is not necessary to sort next overlapping set of k numbers again.
```

## Repeated Substring Pattern (September 3rd)

Given a non-empty string check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together. You may assume the given string consists of lowercase English letters only and its length will not exceed 10000.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "abab"
Output: True
Explanation: It's the substring "ab" twice.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "aba"
Output: False
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: "abcabcabcabc"
Output: True
Explanation: It's the substring "abc" four times. (And the substring "abcabc" twice.)
```

## Partition Labels (September 4th)

A string `S` of lowercase English letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.
```

**Note:**

- `S` will have length in range `[1, 500]`.
- `S` will consist of lowercase English letters (`'a'` to `'z'`) only.

**Hint 1:**

Try to greedily choose the smallest partition that includes the first letter. If you have something like "abaccbdeffed", then you might need to add b. You can use an map like "last['b'] = 5" to help you expand the width of your partition.

## All Elements in Two Binary Search Trees (September 5th)

Given two binary search trees `root1` and `root2`.

Return a list containing all the integers from both trees sorted in **ascending** order.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root1 = [2,1,4], root2 = [1,0,3]
Output: [0,1,1,2,3,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root1 = [0,-10,10], root2 = [5,1,7,0,2]
Output: [-10,0,0,1,2,5,7,10]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root1 = [], root2 = [5,1,7,0,2]
Output: [0,1,2,5,7]
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: root1 = [0,-10,10], root2 = []
Output: [-10,0,10]
```

**Example 5:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/18/q2-e5-.png)

```
Input: root1 = [1,null,8], root2 = [8,1]
Output: [1,1,8,8]
```

**Constraints:**

- Each tree has at most `5000` nodes.
- Each node's value is between `[-10^5, 10^5]`.

**Hint #1:**

Traverse the first tree in list1 and the second tree in list2.

**Hint #2:**

Merge the two trees in one list and sort it.

## Image Overlap (September 6th)

Two images `A` and `B` are given, represented as binary, square matrices of the same size.  (A binary matrix has only 0s and 1s as values.)

We translate one image however we choose (sliding it left, right, up, or down any number of units), and place it on top of the other image.  After, the overlap of this translation is the number of positions that have a 1 in both images.

(Note also that a translation does **not** include any kind of rotation.)

What is the largest possible overlap?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: A = [[1,1,0],
            [0,1,0],
            [0,1,0]]
       B = [[0,0,0],
            [0,1,1],
            [0,0,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: We slide A to right by 1 unit and down by 1 unit.
```

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length = A[0].length = B.length = B[0].length <= 30`
2. `0 <= A[i][j], B[i][j] <= 1`

## Word Pattern (September 7th)

Given a `pattern` and a string `str`, find if `str` follows the same pattern.

Here **follow** means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in `pattern` and a **non-empty** word in `str`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish"
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input:pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: false
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input:pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog"
Output: false
```

**Notes:**

You may assume `pattern` contains only lowercase letters, and `str` contains lowercase letters that may be separated by a single space.
