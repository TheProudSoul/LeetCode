# Week 4: September 22nd - September 28th

## Majority Element II (Sept. 22nd)

Given an integer array of size `n`, find all elements that appear more than `⌊ n/3 ⌋` times.

**Follow-up:** Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: [3]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: [1]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`

**Hint #1**

How many majority elements could it possibly have?

## Gas Station (Sept. 23rd)

There are *N* gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station *i* is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from station *i* to its next station *(i+1)*. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

**Note:**

- If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
- Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
- Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
cost = [3,4,5,1,2]

Output: 3

Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 
gas  = [2,3,4]
cost = [3,4,3]

Output: -1

Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
```

## Find the Difference (Sept. 24th)

You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: "a"
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = "ae", t = "aea"
Output: "a"
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `t.length == s.length + 1`
- `s` and `t` consist of lower-case English letters.

## Largest Number (Sept. 25th)

Given a list of non-negative integers `nums`, arrange them such that they form the largest number.

**Note:** The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [10,2]
Output: "210"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,30,34,5,9]
Output: "9534330"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: "1"
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: nums = [10]
Output: "10"
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 109`

## Teemo Attacking (Sept. 26th)

In LOL world, there is a hero called Teemo and his attacking can make his enemy Ashe be in poisoned condition. Now, given the Teemo's attacking **ascending** time series towards Ashe and the poisoning time duration per Teemo's attacking, you need to output the total time that Ashe is in poisoned condition.

You may assume that Teemo attacks at the very beginning of a specific time point, and makes Ashe be in poisoned condition immediately.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,4], 2
Output: 4
Explanation: At time point 1, Teemo starts attacking Ashe and makes Ashe be poisoned immediately. 
This poisoned status will last 2 seconds until the end of time point 2. 
And at time point 4, Teemo attacks Ashe again, and causes Ashe to be in poisoned status for another 2 seconds. 
So you finally need to output 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2], 2
Output: 3
Explanation: At time point 1, Teemo starts attacking Ashe and makes Ashe be poisoned. 
This poisoned status will last 2 seconds until the end of time point 2. 
However, at the beginning of time point 2, Teemo attacks Ashe again who is already in poisoned status. 
Since the poisoned status won't add up together, though the second poisoning attack will still work at time point 2, it will stop at the end of time point 3. 
So you finally need to output 3.
```

**Note:**

1. You may assume the length of given time series array won't exceed 10000.
2. You may assume the numbers in the Teemo's attacking time series and his poisoning time duration per attacking are non-negative integers, which won't exceed 10,000,000.

## Evaluate Division (Sept. 27th)

You are given `equations` in the format `A / B = k`, where `A` and `B` are variables represented as strings, and `k` is a real number (floating-point number). Given some `queries`, return the answers. If the answer does not exist, return `-1.0`.

The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will result in no division by zero and there is no contradiction.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0], queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]
Output: [6.00000,0.50000,-1.00000,1.00000,-1.00000]
Explanation: 
Given: a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0
queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ?
return: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"],["bc","cd"]], values = [1.5,2.5,5.0], queries = [["a","c"],["c","b"],["bc","cd"],["cd","bc"]]
Output: [3.75000,0.40000,5.00000,0.20000]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: equations = [["a","b"]], values = [0.5], queries = [["a","b"],["b","a"],["a","c"],["x","y"]]
Output: [0.50000,2.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000]
```

**Constraints:**


- `1 <= equations.length <= 20`
- `equations[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= equations[i][0], equations[i][1] <= 5`
- `values.length == equations.length`
- `0.0 < values[i] <= 20.0`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 20`
- `queries[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= queries[i][0], queries[i][1] <= 5`
- `equations[i][0], equations[i][1], queries[i][0], queries[i][1]` consist of lower case English letters and digits.

**Hint 1:**

Do you recognize this as a graph problem?

## Subarray Product Less Than K (Sept. 28th)

Your are given an array of positive integers `nums`.

Count and print the number of (contiguous) subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is less than `k`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [10, 5, 2, 6], k = 100
Output: 8
Explanation: The 8 subarrays that have product less than 100 are: [10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6].
Note that [10, 5, 2] is not included as the product of 100 is not strictly less than k.
```

**Note:**

- `0 < nums.length <= 50000.`
- `0 < nums[i] < 1000.`
- `0 <= k < 10^6.`

**Hint #1:**

For each j, let opt(j) be the smallest i so that nums[i] * nums[i+1] * ... * nums[j] is less than k. opt is an increasing function.
