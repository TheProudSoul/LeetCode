#  Week 2: September 8th - September 14th

## Sum of Root To Leaf Binary Numbers (September 8th)

Given a binary tree, each node has value `0` or `1`.  Each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit.  For example, if the path is `0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1`, then this could represent `01101` in binary, which is `13`.

For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from the root to that leaf.

Return the sum of these numbers.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/04/04/sum-of-root-to-leaf-binary-numbers.png)
```
Input: [1,0,1,0,1,0,1]
Output: 22
Explanation: (100) + (101) + (110) + (111) = 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22
```

**Note:**

1. The number of nodes in the tree is between `1` and `1000`.
2. node.val is `0` or `1`.
3. The answer will not exceed `2^31 - 1`.

**Hint 1:**

Find each path, then transform that path to an integer in base 10.

## Compare Version Numbers (September 9th)

Compare two version numbers version1 and version2.
If `version1 > version2` return `1`; if `version1 < version2` return `-1`;otherwise return `0`.

You may assume that the version strings are non-empty and contain only digits and the `.` character.

The `.` character does not represent a decimal point and is used to separate number sequences.

For instance, `2.5` is not "two and a half" or "half way to version three", it is the fifth second-level revision of the second first-level revision.

You may assume the default revision number for each level of a version number to be `0`. For example, version number `3.4` has a revision number of `3` and `4` for its first and second level revision number. Its third and fourth level revision number are both `0`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: version1 = "0.1", version2 = "1.1"
Output: -1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: version1 = "1.0.1", version2 = "1"
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: version1 = "7.5.2.4", version2 = "7.5.3"
Output: -1
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: version1 = "1.01", version2 = "1.001"
Output: 0
Explanation: Ignoring leading zeroes, both “01” and “001" represent the same number “1”
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: version1 = "1.0", version2 = "1.0.0"
Output: 0
Explanation: The first version number does not have a third level revision number, which means its third level revision number is default to "0"
```

**Note:**

1. Version strings are composed of numeric strings separated by dots `.` and this numeric strings **may** have leading zeroes.
2. Version strings do not start or end with dots, and they will not be two consecutive dots.

## Bulls and Cows (September 10th)

You are playing the following [Bulls and Cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows) game with your friend: You write down a number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. Each time your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint that indicates how many digits in said guess match your secret number exactly in both digit and position (called "bulls") and how many digits match the secret number but locate in the wrong position (called "cows"). Your friend will use successive guesses and hints to eventually derive the secret number.

Write a function to return a hint according to the secret number and friend's guess, use `A` to indicate the bulls and `B` to indicate the cows. 

Please note that both secret number and friend's guess may contain duplicate digits.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"

Output: "1A3B"

Explanation: 1 bull and 3 cows. The bull is 8, the cows are 0, 1 and 7.
```

**Example 1:**

```
Input: secret = "1123", guess = "0111"

Output: "1A1B"

Explanation: The 1st 1 in friend's guess is a bull, the 2nd or 3rd 1 is a cow.
```

**Note:** You may assume that the secret number and your friend's guess only contain digits, and their lengths are always equal.
