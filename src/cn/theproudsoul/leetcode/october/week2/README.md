# Week 2: October 8th - October 14th

## Binary Search (Oct. 8th)

Given a sorted (in ascending order) integer array `nums` of `n` elements and a `target` value, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index, otherwise return -1.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
```

**Note:**

1. You may assume that all elements in `nums` are unique.
2. n will be in the range `[1, 10000]`.
3. The value of each element in `nums` will be in the range `[-9999, 9999]`.

## Serialize and Deserialize BST (Oct. 9th)

Serialization is converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a **binary search tree**. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string, and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**The encoded string should be as compact as possible.**

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,1,3]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 104`
- The input tree is **guaranteed** to be a binary search tree.
