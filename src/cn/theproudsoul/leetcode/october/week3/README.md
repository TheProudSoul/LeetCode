# Week 3: October 15th - October 21st

## Rotate Array (October 15th)

Given an array, rotate the array to the right by *k* steps, where *k* is non-negative.

**Follow up:**

- Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
- Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104`
- `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
- `0 <= k <= 105`

**Hint #1:**

The easiest solution would use additional memory and that is perfectly fine.

**Hint #2:**

The actual trick comes when trying to solve this problem without using any additional memory. This means you need to use the original array somehow to move the elements around. Now, we can place each element in its original location and shift all the elements around it to adjust as that would be too costly and most likely will time out on larger input arrays.

**Hint #3:**

One line of thought is based on reversing the array (or parts of it) to obtain the desired result. Think about how reversal might potentially help us out by using an example.

**Hint #4:**
The other line of thought is a tad bit complicated but essentially it builds on the idea of placing each element in its original position while keeping track of the element originally in that position. Basically, at every step, we place an element in its rightful position and keep track of the element already there or the one being overwritten in an additional variable. We can't do this in one linear pass and the idea here is based on **cyclic-dependencies** between elements.

## Search a 2D Matrix (October 16th)

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an `m x n` matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

- Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/05/mat.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,50]], target = 3
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/05/mat2.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,50]], target = 13
Output: false
```

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix = [], target = 0
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `0 <= m, n <= 100`
- `-104 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 104`

## Repeated DNA Sequences (Oct. 17th)

All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`, for example: `"ACGAATTCCG"`. When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s[i]` is `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, or `'T'`.

## Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV (Oct. 18th)

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most `k` transactions.

**Notice** that you may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= k <= 109`
- `0 <= prices.length <= 104`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`

## Clone Graph (Oct. 20th)

Given a reference of a node in a [connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)#Connected_graph) undirected graph.

Return a [deep copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a val (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```

**Test case format:**

For simplicity’s sake, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val = 1`, the second node with `val = 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**Adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/04/133_clone_graph_question.png)

```
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph.png)

```
Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
```

**Example 4:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph-1.png)

```
Input: adjList = [[2],[1]]
Output: [[2],[1]]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `Node.val` is unique for each node.
- Number of Nodes will not exceed 100.
- There is no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
- The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.
