# Week 4: August 22nd - August 28th

## Random Point in Non-overlapping Rectangles (August 22nd)

Given a list of **non-overlapping** axis-aligned rectangles `rects`, write a function `pick` which randomly and uniformily picks an integer point in the space covered by the rectangles.

**Note:**

1. An **integer point** is a point that has integer coordinates. 
2. A point on the perimeter of a rectangle is **included** in the space covered by the rectangles. 
3. `i`th rectangle = `rects[i]` = `[x1,y1,x2,y2]`, where `[x1, y1]` are the integer coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and `[x2, y2]` are the integer coordinates of the top-right corner.
4. length and width of each rectangle does not exceed `2000`.
5. `1 <= rects.length <= 100`
6. `pick` return a point as an array of integer coordinates `[p_x, p_y]`
7. `pick` is called at most `10000` times.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
[[[[1,1,5,5]]],[],[],[]]
Output: 
[null,[4,1],[4,1],[3,3]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick","pick","pick"]
[[[[-2,-2,-1,-1],[1,0,3,0]]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output: 
[null,[-1,-2],[2,0],[-2,-1],[3,0],[-2,-2]]
```

**Explanation of Input Syntax:**

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. `Solution`'s constructor has one argument, the array of rectangles `rects`. `pick` has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.

## Stream of Characters (August 23rd)

Implement the `StreamChecker` class as follows:

- `StreamChecker(words)`: Constructor, init the data structure with the given words.
- `query(letter)`: returns true if and only if for some k >= 1, the last k characters queried (in order from oldest to newest, including this letter just queried) spell one of the words in the given list.

**Example:**

```
StreamChecker streamChecker = new StreamChecker(["cd","f","kl"]); // init the dictionary.
streamChecker.query('a');          // return false
streamChecker.query('b');          // return false
streamChecker.query('c');          // return false
streamChecker.query('d');          // return true, because 'cd' is in the wordlist
streamChecker.query('e');          // return false
streamChecker.query('f');          // return true, because 'f' is in the wordlist
streamChecker.query('g');          // return false
streamChecker.query('h');          // return false
streamChecker.query('i');          // return false
streamChecker.query('j');          // return false
streamChecker.query('k');          // return false
streamChecker.query('l');          // return true, because 'kl' is in the wordlist
```

**Note:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 2000`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 2000`
- Words will only consist of lowercase English letters.
- Queries will only consist of lowercase English letters.
- The number of queries is at most 40000.

**Hint #1:**

Put the words into a trie, and manage a set of pointers within that trie.

## Sum of Left Leaves (August 24th)

Find the sum of all left leaves in a given binary tree.

**Example:**

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively. Return 24.
```

## Minimum Cost For Tickets (August 25th)

In a country popular for train travel, you have planned some train travelling one year in advance.  The days of the year that you will travel is given as an array `days`.  Each day is an integer from `1` to `365`.

Train tickets are sold in 3 different ways:

a 1-day pass is sold for `costs[0]` dollars;
a 7-day pass is sold for `costs[1]` dollars;
a 30-day pass is sold for `costs[2]` dollars.
The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.  For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of `days`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 11
Explanation: 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.
On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.
On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.
In total you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 17
Explanation: 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.
On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.
In total you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.
```

**Note:**

- `1 <= days.length <= 365`
- `1 <= days[i] <= 365`
- `days` is in strictly increasing order.
- `costs.length == 3`
- `1 <= costs[i] <= 1000`

## Fizz Buzz (August 26th)

Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to n.

But for multiples of three it should output “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five output “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five output “FizzBuzz”.

**Example:**

```
n = 15,

Return:
[
    "1",
    "2",
    "Fizz",
    "4",
    "Buzz",
    "Fizz",
    "7",
    "8",
    "Fizz",
    "Buzz",
    "11",
    "Fizz",
    "13",
    "14",
    "FizzBuzz"
]
```

## Find Right Interval (August 27th)

Given a set of intervals, for each of the interval i, check if there exists an interval j whose start point is bigger than or equal to the end point of the interval i, which can be called that j is on the "right" of i.
 
For any interval i, you need to store the minimum interval j's index, which means that the interval j has the minimum start point to build the "right" relationship for interval i. If the interval j doesn't exist, store -1 for the interval i. Finally, you need output the stored value of each interval as an array.
 
**Note:**
 
1. You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
2. You may assume none of these intervals have the same start point.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [ [1,2] ]

Output: [-1]

Explanation: There is only one interval in the collection, so it outputs -1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [ [1,4], [2,3], [3,4] ]

Output: [-1, 2, -1]

Explanation: There is no satisfied "right" interval for [1,4] and [3,4].
For [2,3], the interval [3,4] has minimum-"right" start point.
```
